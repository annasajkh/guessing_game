# Trying dart again 

Very cool language


have features that i like
- static typing
- null safety
- doesn't force you into 1 paradigm and or build around mainly 1 paradigm
- compile to machine code or JIT compiled


stuff that i don't like
- Too much abstraction, stuff like `abstract interface class` or `class Dancer extends Musician with MusicalPerformer` for me i don't like too much abstraction
- Weird placement, like the source code is in bin folder, why? that should usually contain binary executable
- No protected access modifier, you have to use a third party package to get that, i think they will add this in the future
- Doesn't have float only double
- Very opinionated compiler
